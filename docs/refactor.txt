0. EXAMPLE:  
   File: AngryBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove(), line 54
   Issue Idetified: Magic number
   Description of fix:  Replaced with constant EMPTY_DISTRICT_PENALTY

1. File: AngryBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #):districtScores(), line 70
   Issue Idetified: Method is too long
   Description of fix: refactored method into calling separate methods to have a simpler algorithm

2. File: AngryBot.java,chickenBot.java,SpressoBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #):minimumScore() line 200 in TimBot.java
   Issue Idetified: repeated code calculated the minimum over all score in these classes
   Description of fix: made a public method in TimBot.java which they all  inherit

3. File: ChickenBot, SpressoBot and TimBot
   Location (method/approx. line #):useEnergyToMove()/ line 212 in TimBot.java
   Issue Idetified: duplicate code
   Description of fix: added method for decreasing bot energy when moving

4. File: ChickenBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getScores()/ Line 65
   Issue Idetified: Method getNextMove() was too long
   Description of fix: seperated for loop into seperate method to create a less complex algorithm

5. File: SpressoBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): GetMoveScore()/line65
   Issue Idetified: Method getNextMove was too long
   Description of fix: seperated for loop into a seperate method to create a less complex algorithm
